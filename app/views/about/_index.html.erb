<p>My name is Albalenys (pronounced <em>Al-ba-leh-knees</em>) De Los Santos, but I'm more commonly known as <strong>Abby</strong>. I'm a developer and recent Dev Bootcamp graduate. I'm also a Computer Science student at New York's City College.</p>
<p>Currently I work on small projects and mentor at Dev Bootcamp to expand my skills. I also love attending meetups and hackathons. <a href="mailto:www.AlbalenysD@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you would be interested in working together or if there are any interesting events coming up.</p>
